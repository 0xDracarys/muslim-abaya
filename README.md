## Technical Architecture

The project consists of two separate Next.js applications that work together:

1. **Admin Dashboard** (`ecommerce-admin`) - For store management
2. **Store Frontend** (`ecommerce-store`) - For customer shopping

### Data Access Pattern

The store frontend implements a dual data access approach:
1. **Primary: Direct Database Access** - The store connects directly to the MongoDB database using Prisma
2. **Fallback: API Calls** - If direct database access fails, the store falls back to calling the Admin API

This approach provides:
- Improved performance with direct database reads
- Redundancy in case of database connection issues
- Consistent data between admin and store

### Database Schema

The MongoDB database schema includes the following key models:

- **Store**: The top-level entity for multi-store support
- **Billboard**: Promotional banners shown on the store
- **Category**: Product categories with billboard associations
- **Size**: Product size options
- **Color**: Product color options
- **Product**: Core product information
- **Variant**: Specific product variants (size/color combinations)
- **Image**: Product images
- **Order**: Customer orders
- **OrderItem**: Individual items within an order
- **User**: User accounts (including auth via Clerk)
- **Favorite**: User-saved favorite products

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** 
- React 18
- Next.js 13 (App Router)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components
- Zustand for state management
- SWR for data fetching
- React Hot Toast for notifications

**Backend:**
- Prisma ORM
- MongoDB database
- Next.js API routes
- Server Components & Server Actions

**Third-party Services:**
- Clerk (Authentication)
- Cloudinary (Image storage)
- Stripe (Payment processing)
- Uploadthing (File uploads)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MongoDB database (cloud or local)
- Accounts with Clerk, Cloudinary, and Stripe

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-project.git
cd ecommerce-project
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard Setup

```bash
cd ecommerce-admin
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `ecommerce-admin` directory with:

```bash
# Environment Variables
# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_Y29uY3JldGUtbXV0dC02LmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xRcw8YjDFj5GxfabiwRZHz9yQM9I43PYM2nrjYAst4
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/

# MongoDB
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ecommerce"

# Cloudinary
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Stripe
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key
FRONTEND_STORE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# For local development webhook
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_local_development_secret
```

Initialize Prisma:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

Start the admin dashboard:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Store Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../ecommerce-store
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `ecommerce-store` directory with:

```bash
# Database - Same connection string as admin
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ecommerce"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3001"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YourSuperSecretKeyHere-UseAStrongSecretKey"

# Admin API Connection - Base URL without store ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"

# Stripe - Same keys as admin
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_local_development_secret

# Cloudinary - Same as admin
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Clerk - Same keys as admin
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_Y29uY3JldGUtbXV0dC02LmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xRcw8YjDFj5GxfabiwRZHz9yQM9I43PYM2nrjYAst4
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

Initialize Prisma for the store:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Start the store:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Initial Setup Steps

1. Access the Admin Dashboard at http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with Clerk
3. Create a new store
4. Add billboards, categories, sizes, and colors
5. Add products with variants
6. Visit the Store Frontend at http://localhost:3001 to see your products

## Data Synchronization

The store and admin dashboard are automatically synchronized through:
1. Shared MongoDB database
2. Identical Prisma schema
3. Dual data access strategy (direct DB + API fallback)

This ensures that any changes made in the admin dashboard immediately appear in the store.

## Key Workflows

### Admin Workflows

1. **Creating a Product**:
   - Navigate to Products in your store
   - Click "Add New"
   - Fill in product details (name, description, price)
   - Upload product images
   - Select a category
   - Set featured and archived status
   - Create variants with size and color combinations
   - Set stock levels for each variant
   - Save the product

2. **Managing Orders**:
   - View all orders in the Orders section
   - Check payment status (paid/unpaid)
   - Mark orders as sent when fulfilled
   - View customer details

3. **Creating Billboards**:
   - Go to Billboards section
   - Add a new billboard with image and text
   - Assign to store front or specific categories

### Store Workflows

1. **Customer Shopping**:
   - Browse products by category or featured items
   - Filter by size, color, or price
   - View product details
   - Select variant (size/color)
   - Add to cart
   - Proceed to checkout
   - Enter shipping information
   - Complete payment with Stripe

2. **Account Management**:
   - Create account or shop as guest
   - Save favorite products
   - View order history and status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection
- Ensure your MongoDB connection string is correct
- Check that both projects use the exact same `DATABASE_URL`
- Run `npx prisma generate` after any schema changes

#### API Errors
- Check console for error messages about API calls
- Verify the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set to `http://localhost:3000/api` (without store ID)
- Ensure the admin server is running when accessing the store

#### Missing Products/Categories
- Look for database connection errors in the console
- Verify products are marked as "Featured" to appear on the homepage
- Check products aren't archived in the admin panel

#### Category JSON Errors
- If you see "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'" errors, implement direct DB access for categories
- This error occurs when the API fallback doesn't return proper JSON

#### Clerk Authentication Issues
- Ensure Clerk environment variables are correctly set
- Check for CORS issues if using custom domains

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features

1. **Update Prisma Schema**: Make changes in `prisma/schema.prisma` in admin project
2. **Generate Prisma Client**: Run `npx prisma generate` in both projects
3. **Copy Schema**: Copy schema changes to store project
4. **Update DB**: Run `npx prisma db push` from admin project

### API Routes

When adding new API endpoints:
1. Create route in admin project (e.g., `/api/[storeId]/new-feature`)
2. Update store actions to fetch from this endpoint as a fallback
3. Implement direct DB access in store actions as primary method

### Dual Access Pattern

When implementing a new data access function:
1. Create a function in the store's `actions` directory
2. First attempt to access data directly via Prisma
3. If Prisma access fails, fall back to API call
4. Include proper error handling for both methods
5. Return consistent data structure regardless of source
